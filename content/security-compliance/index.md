# Security and Compliance

Safespring's cloud services are built on a foundation of internationally recognized security and compliance standards, ensuring your data is protected and regulatory requirements are met.

## Overview

In this chapter we outline the standards that Safespring uses to implement its services.

Because we run a variety of services each with their own security and compliance implementations.

For that reason you can find a chapter 'Security and Compliance' in every service's documentation.

Our internal 'DevOps Guidelines' are the reference material for all our services. They set out the minimal guidelines for all our services.

## FR2000 certified

Safespring is currently FR2000 certified. FR2000 combines requirements from ISO 9001 (quality), ISO 14001 (environment), ISO 45001 (work environment), ISO 27001 (information security), and systematic fire safety. This means customers benefit from a holistic approach where quality, security, sustainability, and safety are all managed within one framework. Customers can trust that products and services are delivered according to well-defined processes, minimizing risks of errors, delays, or inconsistencies. Continuous improvement is built into the system, ensuring ongoing enhancements in quality and efficiency.

## ISO 27001 certification process

Safespring aims to achieve ISO 27001 certification for Information Security Management Systems, providing:

- Systematic approach to managing sensitive information

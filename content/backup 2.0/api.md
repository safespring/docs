# API

## Safespring Cloud Backup API

Safespring has deployed a public API that can be used to automate TSM client (node) management, billing and orchestration. The API is implemented as a `RESTful` API, accessible via [https://portal-api.backup.sto2.safedc.net/v1/help](https://portal-api.backup.sto2.safedc.net/v1/help).

API access credentials can you create on your own in your business unit at the [Safespring Backup Portal](https://portal.backup.sto2.safedc.net/)

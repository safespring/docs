# API

## Safespring Cloud Backup API

Safespring has deployed a public API that can be used to automate TSM client (node) management. The API is implemented as a `RESTful` API, accessible via https://api.cloud.ipnett.se/.

Usage examples can be found in https://github.com/IPnett/cloud-BaaS/blob/master/API.md.

API access credentials are created out of band via the Safespring Cloud Service Portal.

## Create Consumption Unit

For more information please read [How-To Consumption Units](howto/consumption-units.md)

Login to [Safespring Backup Portal](baas-portal) with your credentials. [Need new credentials?](faq.md) talk to our [support](../service/support.md)

When you login for the first time you will see a empty desktop but if you already have node assigned you will see a summary on all created nodes.

Click on the "Consumption Units" tab and then "Add"

Type a friendly name, e.g. hostname or FQDN. and press "Add"
When the consumption unit has been created the portal will ask you if you want to add/assign a backup node to the consumption unit, press "Yes" to continue.

Fillout the form like, Platform, preferred backup server, Domain, Client Option set and contact details (e.g. Server owner E-Mail or Support Email).

We are recommending that you let "Data-source" be empty to let us randomize the nodename.
Press "Activate" to proceed with the activation of your consumption unit.

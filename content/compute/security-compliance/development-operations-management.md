# Development and Operations Management

This document outlines the development and operations management requirements and practices for Safespring Compute services.

## 6.1 Environment Separation

Safespring compute is currently developed using 3 environments: development, staging/QA, and production.

Customers always run their workloads on the production environment.

Safespring has a dedicated staging environment that runs within the same production security measures as the production environments. This environment is used for upgrade testing, bug fixing, etc.

Safespring never transfers customer data to other environments.

## 6.2 Change Management

Change management is implemented as a GitOps workflow. Changes are made into feature branches and merged into the main branch after approval.

Branch protection is implemented to ensure only team members can review pull requests. A minimum of one approval from a team member that is not the author of the pull request is required and enforced.


## 6.3 Data Masking

!!! note "Data Masking"

    Data masking is not implemented. We never transfer customer data to other environments than the production environment.

## 6.4 Production data in acceptance environments

!!! note "Production data in acceptance environments"

    Production data is never transferred to acceptance environments.

## 6.5 Audit and Testing Protection

*Information about protecting audit trails, testing environment security, and maintaining data integrity during security assessments and compliance testing will be outlined here.*

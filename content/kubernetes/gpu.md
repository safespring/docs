# Making use of GPU

In order to make use of GPU, one must add or already have worker nodes with [GPU flavors](../compute/flavors). Given that we use Talos Linux, we cannot make use of [NVIDIA GPU Operator](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/index.html) and instead we install [NVIDIA device plugin for Kubernetes](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin).

## Example job

```bash
âžœ cat <<EOF | kubectl --kubeconfig=kubeconf-demo apply -f -

# Safespring documentation

This site contains documentation for Safespring services and user resources.

* For service status, go to our [statuspage](https://status.safespring.com)
* For support, see our [support page][sup]

!!! note "New support address for all services"
    We will be adding a new address for tickets, support@safespring.com to replace the previous     support addresses under cloud.ipnett.se/no. The old addresses will continue working for     a while, but we hope it will simplify your experience by having a single point of access    regardless of which service you need help with.

!!! info "Known issues"
    Please review our list of [known issues][ki] to avoid spending time on issues
    we are already aware of.
